# Hexasense API v0.1 - Hardware Implementation

## Hardware Description

The hardware implementation to add a proprioceptive sensing system to the HEXA Robot can be described as having three component parts to it's structure.

- A "Digital Twin" Data Processing & Relay System - Comprising of an off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi 4B SBC
- An Analogue To Digital Sensing & Conversion System - Comprising of a series of potentiometers mechanically coupled to the robot's actuators and an off-the-shelf ADC printed circuit board interfaced with the Data Processing & Relay System using the I2C protocol
- The Structural Hardware Assembly - A series of plastic parts manufactured using an FDM rapid prototyping process and designed to integrate the sensing system with the robot's hardware

These three component parts function together to deliver the desired actuator positional data required by the project.

## Schematic Diagram of Electronic Components

As this system uses off-the-shelf products as part of the complete integration, and as such these products are well documented by their manufacturers, detailed schematics of those products will be omitted from this documentation. Links to these resources will however be provided.
